# The Fitness Blog

IMAGE

This was the project exam used to showcase what we'd learned over the first year. The theme of the blog was up to me to decide, so I chose to create a
fitness blog.

## Description

Our project exam was our chance to create a website from scratch using all the tools we've learned during the first year of the Front-End Development
Course.

Underneath you can find the most important criterias we had to include in our project.

-	Decide on the theme for the blog you’re going to make
- The project should at least contain the following pages:
  - Home Page
  - Blog specific page
  - About page
  - Contact Page
  - Blogs page
-	Install WordPress on your web host and add the blogs on the admin panel. 
-	Build your website using HTML, CSS and JavaScript making a call to the WordPress REST API to fetch your data.
-	Install Hotjar on your website.
- Use JavaScript for contact page form validation, show error messages if the values in the textboxes do not meet the requirements:
  -	Name (Should be more than 5 characters long)
  -	Email address (Must be a valid email address)
  -	Subject (Should be more than 15 characters long)
  -	Message content (Should be more than 25 characters long)
- The Home page should have a carousel
- The blog posts page should show the first 10 blogs, and the user should click to view more results which then show underneath the first 10 blogs.
- The content of the blog specific page should be dynamically built using a query string parameter based on whatever link the user clicked. The title of the blog specific page should change based on the blog that has been clicked on e.g. “My Blog | An Article I Wrote”.
- If images on the blog post page are clicked, a modal should appear giving the user a bigger view of that image. Clicking outside the image should hide the modal.
